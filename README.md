# Python_Notebook
This is a Python cookbook for entry level python learners, especially for data science specialty.

As one of you guys, I learned Python by myself. It was really painful at the very beginning, even though I had some R programming experience before switching to Python. But once I worked out my first python project, I started to enjoy it. So don't freak out if you got stuck at any stage, we are all learning from mistakes. 

I decide to collect my notes and publish them, you can treat these codes as a cookbook for your study. The notes would contain basic functions in Python, and also some common used / fancy modules I have ever worked with. I will try my best to hold some examples, but if you encounter some issues when following my steps or you got any comments about my codes, feel free to interact with me. I don't plan to teach anything to you, but if you found my work helps you in any way, it would be the best feedback to me.

Now, let's learn something together.

Again, don't freak out when you got stuck, it's common for programmers. Be patient, and have fun.

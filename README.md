# Python_Notebook
This is a Python cookbook for entry level python data science learners.

As one of you guys, I learned Python by myself. It was really painful at the very beginning, even though I had some R programming experience before switching to Python. But once I worked out my first python project, I started to enjoy it. So don't freak out if you got stuck at any stage, we are all learning from mistakes. 

I decide to collect my notes and publish them to you, you can follow my steps to get into data science programing in Python. It won't be a teaching-learing approach, whenever you got any questons or comments, feel free to interact with me. We could always learn something together. I will try my best to hold examples for better understand, you can treat these codes as a cookbook for your study.
